# Robot-Navigation
Our Project was Minesweepers Robot that is a robot used to detect mine above and under ground, it also gives the coordinates of the mine within the detection area.
We used metal detecor sensor and proximity sensor to detect the mines.
We made an algorithm for the robot localiztion which we can get the mine location from it, we wrote this algroithm using Arduino C (based on C++), the algorithm process the data from two sensors to get the robots' location. These two sensors are Encoder and gyroscope, encoder for calculating linear distance and gyroscope to detect the orientation of the robot. 
We also used python to draw a 2D Map for the location of the mines in the required area and indicates whether it is above or under ground on the map.
